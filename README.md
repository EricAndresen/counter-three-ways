# React + Redux

Redux can be confusing, not least because of all the lingo. 
This is an example of a simple counter in both React and React + Redux to help me think more clearly about how state is managed in each paradigm. 

There are two branches. "Master" is plain React. "Redux" is implemented with React + Redux.

_Note: There's no doubt Redux is massively overpowered for an application this small, but removing the complexity of a larger app shows exactly how data is flowing in _
