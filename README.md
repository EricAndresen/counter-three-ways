# React + Redux

Redux can be confusing, not least because of all the lingo. 
This is an example of a simple counter in both React and React + Redux to help me think more clearly about how state is managed in each paradigm. 

There are two branches. "master" is in React and "redux" is with React + Redux. To see each simply use git checkout <NAME>.

_Note: There's no doubt Redux is massively overpowered for an application this small which means lots of extra code, but removing the complexity of a larger app shows exactly how data is flowing - from a single source. This is a key component of creating being able to do a truly functional style in react prevents fragmenting state across multiple components. _
