# Counter App with React +/- Redux

Redux can be confusing, not least because of all the lingo. 
This is an example of a simple counter in both React and React + Redux to help me think more clearly about how state is managed in each paradigm. 

There are two branches. "master" is in React and "redux" is with React + Redux. To see each simply use git checkout <NAME>.

*Note: There's no doubt Redux is massively overpowered for an application this small, which means lots of extra code. Removing the complexity of a larger app shows exactly how data is flowing - from a single source. This is a key component of being able to code in a functional style in react and prevents fragmenting state across multiple components (which is awesome as the application grows.*
